# Valentine-bear
A playful Valentine's Day mini web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

A cute bear ask "will you be my Valentine?"

The "No" button dodges your mouse

Clicking "Yes" triggers heart eyes, an opening envelope, and a random heartfelt message.
Perfect for sharing, learning frontend interactions, or making someone smile.
